PREFACE</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">This</span> volume concludes the series,
begun in 1903, which was intended to comprise all the best traditional
ballads of England and Scotland. The scheme of classification by
subject-matter, arbitrary and haphazard as it may seem to be at one
point or another, has, I&nbsp;think, proved more satisfactory than could
have been anticipated; and in the end I have omitted no ballad without
due justification.</p>

<p>In the fourteen years which have elapsed since the completion of
Professor Child’s collection, there has been discovered, so far as I
know, only one ballad that can claim the right to be added to his roll
of 305 ‘English and Scottish Popular Ballads.’ That one is the carol of
<i>The Bitter Withy</i>, which I was fortunate enough to recover in
1905, which my friend Professor Gerould of Princeton University has
annotated with an erudition worthy of Child, and the genuineness of
which has been sponsored by
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<a name = "pageviii" id = "pageviii"> </a>
Professor Gummere.<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a> I&nbsp;should perhaps have included this in its place in
my Second Series, had I known of it in time, but I still hope to treat
the traditional English Carols separately. I&nbsp;ought to admit here
that the confidence with which I claimed, in my Third Series,
a&nbsp;place on the roll for <i>The Jolly Juggler</i>, has abated, and I
now consider it to be no more than a narrative lyric without any
definitely ‘popular’ characteristics.</p>

<p>These four volumes contain in all 143 ballads, four of which are not
to be found in Child’s collection.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id =
"tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> Thus, out of his 305, I&nbsp;have omitted
more than half; but it must be remembered that his work was a
collection, and mine&mdash;<i>si parva licet componere
magnis</i>&mdash;has been selection. The omitted ballads are
either:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "hanging">
<p>(i) Fragmentary or mutilated;</p>

<p>(ii) Closely related to ballads which I include;</p>

<p>(iii) Uninteresting, <i>e.g.</i> as dealing with obscure history;</p>

<p>(iv) Degenerate.</p>
</div>

<p>The last reason for exclusion particularly affects the Robin Hood
ballads, among which
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<a name = "pageix" id = "pageix"> </a>
Child prints thirty-three late broadsides and fragments which I omit. He
preferred to err by inclusion rather than exclusion, and states that he
has admitted more than one ballad, ‘actually worthless and manifestly
spurious, because of a remote possibility that it might contain relics,
or be a debased representative, of something genuine and better.’<a
class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a></p>

<p>I cannot take leave of nine years’ intermittent work on this
selection without remembering that its ‘only begetter’ was Mr.
A.&nbsp;H. Bullen, with whom I published the first three volumes. While
I regret to think how different it is in the result from the edition he
then envisaged, I&nbsp;gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to him for
the inoculation. The anthologist is strictly a plucker of the flowers of
literature; but the ballads are not literature&mdash;they are lore, and
therefore of warmer human interest.</p>

INTRODUCTION TO THE ROBIN HOOD BALLADS</a></h4>

<div class = "verse">
<p>‘It is our olde manner,’ sayd Robyn,</p>
<p class = "inset">‘To leve but lytell behynde.’</p>
</div>

<p><span class = "firstword">‘It</span> will scarcely be expected that
one should be able to offer an authentic narrative of the life and
transactions of this extraordinary personage. The times in which he
lived, the mode of life he adopted, and the silence or loss of
contemporary writers, are circumstances sufficiently favourable, indeed,
to romance, but altogether inimical to historical truth.’ In these words
Joseph Ritson, the first and most painstaking of those well-meaning
scholars who have tried to associate the outlaw with ‘historical truth,’
begins his ‘Life of Robin Hood,’ an account which occupies ten pages of
his book, and is annotated and illustrated through the following one
hundred and five pages. The <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>
includes Robin Hood, as it includes King Arthur; but it is better to
face the truth, and to state boldly that Robin Hood the yeoman
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<a name = "pagexii" id = "pagexii"> </a>
outlaw never existed in the flesh. As the goddess Athena sprang from the
head of Zeus, Robin Hood sprang from the imagination of the English
people.</p>

<p>That being so, he is a creation of whom the English people, who have
kept him so long alive where he was born and bred, should be proud; and
after reflecting on his essential characteristics&mdash;his love of the
poor, his courteous robbery of the higher orders both spiritual and
temporal, his loyalty to the king, his freedom with the king’s deer, and
his esteem of all women for the sake of the Virgin&mdash;an Englishman
should be the first to resent any attempt to identify so truly popular a
hero either with one of several historical nonentities, or with a member
of the aristocracy, or worst of all, with an Aryan sun-myth.</p>

<p>All these attempts have been made at one time or another, but not
until the spirit which begot him had begun to dwindle in the English
heart. If King Arthur is the ideal knight of Celtic chivalry, Robin is
the ideal champion of the popular cause under feudal conditions: his
enemies are bishops, fat monks, and the sheriff who would restrain his
liberty. It is natural that an enfranchised yeoman, who took toll of the
oppressors, and so effected what we still call
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<a name = "pagexiii" id = "pagexiii"> </a>
a redistribution of wealth, should be the hero of the oppressed and the
law-abiding poor; and it is natural that, as social conditions altered
(for better or for worse) with the national prosperity under Elizabeth,
and classes and masses reconsidered their relative positions, Robin
should fall from the popular pantheon, and should degenerate, as we find
him degenerated in the broadsides of the Reformation hacks, into a
swashbuckler unheroic enough to be defeated in quarter-staff bouts and
so undemocratic as to find for himself a noble title and a wife of high
degree.</p>


<p class = "space">
There are, then, four Robin Hoods:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "hanging">
<p>(i) The popular outlaw of the greenwood, as revealed to us in the
older ballads.</p>

<p>(ii) The quasi-historical Robin, the outlaw ennobled (by a
contradiction in terms) as the Earl of Huntingdon, Robert Fitzooth,
etc., and the husband of Matilda.</p>

<p>(iii) One of a number of actual Robert Hoods, whose existence (and
insignificance) has been proved from historical documents.</p>

<p>(iv) Robin Hood, or Robin o’ Wood, explained by German scholars as
the English representative of Woden, or a wood-god, or some other
mythical personage.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<a name = "pagexiv" id = "pagexiv"> </a>
<p>We will now investigate these in turn, attempting so far as may be
possible to keep them distinct.</p>


<h5 class = "section">I. The Ballad Hero Robin Hood</h5>

<p>The earliest known reference to Robin Hood the outlaw was first
pointed out by Bishop Percy, the editor of the <i>Reliques</i>, in
<i>Piers Plowman</i>, the poem written by Langland about 1377, where
Sloth says (B.&nbsp;text, passus v.&nbsp;401):&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
‘But I can [know] rymes of Robyn hood, and Randolf erle of Chestre.’</p>

<p>Observing that this first mention of Robin is as the subject of
ballads, and that he is coupled with another popular hero, one of the
twelfth-century Earls of Chester, we pass to the next reference.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>‘Lytill Ihon and Robyne Hude</p>
<p>Waythmen ware commendyd gude;</p>
<p>In Yngilwode and Barnysdale</p>
<p>Thai oysyd all this tyme thare trawale.’</p>
</div>

<p>This passage, from Wyntoun’s <i>Chronicle of Scotland</i> (about
1420), is referred to the year 1283, and means that Robin and his man
Little John were known as good hunters (cf.&nbsp;‘wight yeomen,’
constantly in the ballads), and they carried on their business in
Inglewood and Barnsdale at this time.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<a name = "pagexv" id = "pagexv"> </a>
<p>In 1439 a petition was presented to Parliament concerning a certain
Piers Venables, of whom it is stated that, having no other livelihood,
he ‘gadered and assembled unto him many misdoers’ and ‘wente into the
wodes in that contrë, like as it hadde be Robyn-hode and his meynë.’</p>

<p>About the same time (c. 1437), a longer description is given in
Fordun’s <i>Scotichronicon</i>, which was revised and continued by
Bower, where the latter states that Robin Hood, ‘that most celebrated
robber,’ was one of the dispossessed and banished followers of Simon de
Montfort. He proceeds, however, to couple with him ‘Litill Johanne’ and
their associates, ‘of whom the foolish vulgar in comedies and tragedies
make lewd entertainment, and are delighted to hear the jesters and
minstrels sing them above all other ballads,’<a class = "tag" name =
"tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> and to describe briefly one of
the ‘tragedies.’</p>

<p>An extract from one more chronicler will suffice, and it should be
noted that these three, Wyntoun, Bower, and Major, are all Scottish.
John Major (or&nbsp;Mair) was born about 1450, and his <i>Historia
Maioris Britanniæ</i> was published in
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
<a name = "pagexvi" id = "pagexvi"> </a>
1521. In the part dealing with the reign of Richard <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span> (lib. iv. cap.&nbsp;ii.), we find:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘About this time it was, as I conceive, that there flourished those
most famous robbers Robert Hood, an Englishman, and Little John, who lay
in wait in the woods, but spoiled of their goods those only who were
wealthy. They took the life of no man, unless either he attacked them or
offered resistance in defence of his property. Robert supported by his
plundering a hundred bowmen, ready fighters every one, with whom four
hundred of the strongest would not dare to engage in combat. The feats
of this Robert are told in song all over Britain. He would allow no
woman to suffer injustice, nor would he spoil the poor, but rather
enriched them from the plunder taken from abbots. The robberies of this
man I condemn, but of all thieves he was the prince and the most gentle
thief.’<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a>
This is repeated almost verbatim in Stow’s <i>Annales</i> (1681).</p>

<p>These five references show that Robin Hood was popular in ballads for
at least a century before the date at which we find those ballads in
print; and apart from the fact that printing is usually the last thing
that happens to a ballad
<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
<a name = "pagexvii" id = "pagexvii"> </a>
of the folk, the language in which they are written is unmistakably
Middle English&mdash;that is to say, the <i>Gest of Robyn Hode</i>
(at&nbsp;least) may be dated nearer 1400 than 1500. But Langland’s
evidence is clear; ‘rymes’ of Robin Hood were widely known by 1377.
Neither Bower nor Major know anything of Robin except what they learnt
from the ballads about him.</p>


<h5 class = "section">II. Robin Hood, Earl of Huntingdon</h5>

<p>In attempting to provide Robin Hood with a noble ancestry, Ritson
quotes, amongst other authorities, a&nbsp;manuscript life of Robin,
which, as it supplied him with other errors, had best be put out of
court at once. This is Sloane <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 780
(Ritson calls it 715, which is due to the fact that in his time Sloane
<span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span> 715-7, 720-1, and 780-1 were
bound up together); it is of the early seventeenth century, which is
much too late for any faith to be put in its statements.</p>

<p>No allusion to the noble descent of Robin Hood has been found earlier
than one in Grafton’s Chronicle (1569), where the author alleges that he
takes this information from ‘an olde and auncient pamphlet.’ As Child
says, we must ‘invoke the spirit of Ritson to pardon the
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
<a name = "pagexviii" id = "pagexviii"> </a>
taking of no very serious notice of Robin Hood’s noble extraction.’</p>

<p>Stukely, an antiquary who published his <i>Palæographia
Britannica</i> in 1746, derived ‘Robert Fitzooth, commonly called Robin
Hood, pretended Earl of Huntingdon,’ from a series of Anglo-Norman
lords.</p>

<p>It would be almost unnecessary to mention the two Elizabethan plays
concerning Robert the Earl, were it not for an ingenious suggestion made
in connection with them. <i>The Downfall of Robert Earl of
Huntington</i>, and <i>The Death</i> of the same, were written by
Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle, and are first mentioned in Henslowe’s
<i>Diary</i> in 1598. The Earl, being outlawed, flies to Sherwood
Forest, accompanied by Matilda, daughter of Lord Fitzwater; and there he
assumes the style and title of Robin Hood, and calls Matilda Maid
Marian. This plot is introduced by an induction in which John Skelton
the poet appears as stage-manager; and it has been suggested that
Munday’s play may be founded on a now-lost interlude or pageant of
Skelton’s composing. Robert, Lord Fitz-Walter, a&nbsp;descendant from
the original Earls of Huntingdon, was patron of the living at Diss, in
Norfolk, which Skelton held.’<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6"

<h5 class = "section">III. Historical Robin Hoods</h5>

<p>In 1852 Joseph Hunter issued, as No. 4 of his ‘Critical and
Historical Tracts,’ <i>The Great Hero of the ancient Minstrelsy of
England, Robin Hood</i>. Amongst other discoveries, he found, in an
Exchequer document of expenses in the royal household of Edward <span
class = "smallroman">II.</span>, the name of ‘Robyn Hode’ occurring
several times as a ‘vadlet’ or ‘porteur de la chambre,’ at the salary of
threepence per diem, between March and November of 1324.</p>

<p>Various other researchers have succeeded in tracing half a dozen
people, all named Robin or Robert Hood, within a period of some forty
years of the fourteenth century; but few have pressed identification
with Robin Hood the outlaw so far as Hunter, ‘who,’ says Professor
Child, ‘could have identified Pigrogromitus and Quinapalus, if he had
given his mind to it.’ Working on the above datum, Hunter shows how
probable it is that Robin Hood the outlaw entered the service of Edward
<span class = "smallroman">II.</span> at Nottingham, where the king was
from November 9-23 in 1323. But the Robin whose fortunes Hunter raked up
was a very bad servant, and within a year from the alleged date was
ignominiously dismissed from the king’s service, with a present of 5s.,
‘because he was no longer able to work’!
<span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
<a name = "pagexx" id = "pagexx"> </a>
Was this the invincible champion of English yeomen? Was this the hand
that launched a thousand shafts?</p>

<p>The only point to which attention need be called is the obvious fact
that ‘Robert Hood’ was not an uncommon combination of names, at least in
fourteenth-century England.</p>


<h5 class = "section">IV. Robin Hood the Myth</h5>

<p>In 1845 Adalbert Kuhn (in Haupt’s <i>Zeitschrift</i>, v. 472-94)
attempted to show that Robin Hood was a mythological figure representing
one of the manifestations of Woden, as a vegetation deity; and half a
century later Sir J.&nbsp;H. Ramsay suggested that he was a wood-spirit
corresponding to the Hodeken of German tradition. Theories such as
this<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href = "#note7">7</a>
seem to be fascinating to all sorts of scholars, perhaps because they
involve continually a minute appreciation of fine shades of probability.
In the present instance they reach a point at which it is suggested that
the rose-garland worn by the Potter&mdash;not in the ballad of <i>Robin
Hood and the Potter</i>, but in the later play&mdash;is a survival of
the Strife between
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
<a name = "pagexxi" id = "pagexxi"> </a>
Summer and Winter. Certainly there is no need to seek a mythological
origin for the Robin Hood of the ballads; but we must proceed to
consider the Robin of folk-drama.</p>

<p>To do this, it is necessary to go back some centuries before the time
at which we first hear of Robin Hood the outlaw, and to follow the
development of the English folk’s summer festival from song and dance to
drama, and from the folk-games&mdash;the ‘Induction of May,’ the
‘Induction of Autumn,’ the ‘Play of the King and the Queen,’ which,
separately or together, were performed at least as early as the
thirteenth century&mdash;to the ‘May-game’ or ‘King’s game’ of the
middle of the fifteenth century. Going back again to the thirteenth
century, and crossing over to France, we find in the <i>fêtes du
mai</i>&mdash;which were evolved, with the help of the minstrels, from
the French folk’s summer festival&mdash;the names of Robin and Marion
customarily appropriated to the king and queen of these
<i>fêtes</i>.</p>

<p>Now between 1450 and 1500 the May-game becomes associated in England
with Robin Hood: setting aside the possibility that Bower’s reference,
mentioned above, to ‘comedies and tragedies,’ may allude to the
May-game, we can find many entries, in parish records from all parts
<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
<a name = "pagexxii" id = "pagexxii"> </a>
of England, which show that the summer folk-festival has developed into
a play of Robin Hood. Further, it has been very plausibly suggested<a
class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href = "#note8">8</a> that about
the same time the <i>French</i> Robin, becoming confused with the
English one, brought in Marion (a&nbsp;French name), and thus supplied
our Robin Hood with his Maid Marian, who has no place in the true
ballads of the outlaw.</p>

<p>In 1473 Sir John Paston wrote a letter in which he refers to a
servant, of whom he says, ‘I&nbsp;have kepyd hym this iii yer to pleye
Saynt Jorge and Robyn Hod and the Shryff of Nottyngham.’ There has also
survived a leaf of manuscript&mdash;perhaps it is only an accident that
it was formerly in the possession of the first editor of the <i>Paston
Letters</i>&mdash;of about the same date, which contains a portion of
the play to which Sir John refers, that of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of
Nottingham,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href =
"#note9">9</a> which is founded upon a story similar to that of the
ballad of <i>Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne</i> (see p.&nbsp;128).
<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
<a name = "pagexxiii" id = "pagexxiii"> </a>
Besides this fragment, we have in William Copland’s edition of the
<i>Gest</i> a dramatic appendix of ‘the playe of Robyn Hoode, verye
proper to be played in Maye games’ (printed <i>c.</i> 1560); this in
fact consists of two plays carelessly tagged together, first <i>Robin
Hood and the Friar</i> (who is distinctly called Friar Tuck), and
second, <i>Robin Hood and the Potter</i> (partly founded on the ballad
of that name). Friar Tuck, it should be noted, occurs also in the
earlier fragmentary play; but there is no friar in Robin Hood’s ‘meynie’
in any of the older ballads, and no Maid Marian in either the older
ballads or the above plays.</p>

<p>These complications of Robin Hood’s company are further confused by
the fact that the morris-dance, which was universally affiliated to the
May-game, borrowed therefrom not only Maid Marian but Robin Hood, Little
John and Friar Tuck; so that amongst the later ballads and broadsides we
find Robin’s company increased. However, by that time Robin himself had
degenerated from the fine character exhibited in the earlier ballads
given in this volume.</p>


<h5 class = "section">Topography of Robin Hood’s Haunts</h5>

<p>Although Robin Hood belongs in legend no more exclusively to any
definite district than
<span class = "pagenum">xxv</span>
<a name = "pagexxv" id = "pagexxv"> </a>
his noble fore-runner King Arthur, yet, like King Arthur, he has become
associated particularly with one or two haunts; and it is no
easier&mdash;nor in the end more profitable&mdash;to reconcile Lyonnesse
with Carlisle and Inglewood<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" id = "tag10"
href = "#note10">10</a> than to disentangle Robin Hood of Barnsdale from
Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest.</p>

alt = "West Riding of Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire"
title = "West Riding of Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire"></p>

<p>The simplest way to begin is to eliminate from our consideration the
numerous Robin Hood’s Hills, Wells, Stones, Oaks, or <ins class =
"correction" title = "‘s’ invisible">Butts</ins>, some of which may be
found as far distant as Gloucestershire and Somerset; for many of these
probably bear his name in much the same way as other natural freaks bear
the Devil’s name. A&nbsp;large number can be found in what may be called
Robin Hood’s home-counties, Yorkshire and those which touch
Yorkshire&mdash;Lancashire, Derby, Nottingham and Lincoln shires.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the evidence of the best ballads goes to show that at one
time there must have been at least two cycles of Robin Hood ballads, one
placing him in Barnsdale, the other allotting him headquarters in
Sherwood; but it appears that even the ballads of the fifteenth century
make little effort to discriminate between the
<span class = "pagenum">xxvi</span>
<a name = "pagexxvi" id = "pagexxvi"> </a>
two. <i>Robin Hood and the Monk</i> (<span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> of <i>c.</i> 1450) introduces us, in its first
five lovely stanzas, to Sherwood; in <i>Robin Hood and the Potter</i>
(<span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> of <i>c.</i> 1500), the scene is
Nottingham, in the Sherwood district. Little John refers to Wentbridge,
which lies in the heart of Barnsdale, yet knows every path in merry
Sherwood.</p>

<p>In the <i>Gest</i>, compiled as it is from ballads of both cycles, no
attempt was made to reconcile their various topographies; but it can be
seen that the general geography of the first division of the <i>Gest</i>
(Fyttes <span class = "smallroman">I.</span> <span class =
"smallroman">II.</span> and <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>) is
that of Barnsdale, while the second division (Fyttes <span class =
"smallroman">III.</span> <span class = "smallroman">V.</span> and <span
class = "smallroman">VI.</span>), dealing with the Sheriff of
Nottingham, mainly centres round Sherwood. In the seventh Fytte, the
King goes, presumably from London (322.<sup>3</sup>), to Nottingham
<i>via</i> Lancashire; and the eighth jumps from Nottingham to
Kirksley.<a class = "tag" name = "tag11" id = "tag11" href =
"#note11">11</a></p>

<p>In <i>Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne</i> (certainly an early ballad,
although the Percy Folio, which supplies the only text, is <i>c.</i>
1650), the scene is specified as Barnsdale; yet at the end the Sheriff
of Nottingham flees to his house as if it were hard by, whereas he had a
fifty-mile run
<span class = "pagenum">xxvii</span>
<a name = "pagexxvii" id = "pagexxvii"> </a>
before him. The later ballads forget Barnsdale altogether.</p>


<h5 class = "section">Barnsdale</h5>

<p>The majority of the places mentioned in the northern or Barnsdale
cycle will be found in the south of the West Riding of Yorkshire,
a&nbsp;district bounded by the East Riding and Lincolnshire to the east,
Derby and Nottingham shires to the south, and the river Calder to the
north. To the west, the natural boundary is the high
<span class = "pagenum">xxviii</span>
<a name = "pagexxviii" id = "pagexxviii"> </a>
ground of the Peak, which divides Manchester from Sheffield.</p>

<p>The town of Barnsley lies slightly to the east of a line joining
Leeds and Sheffield; Barnsdale itself is east and north of Barnsley,
where the high backbone of the Pennines drops towards the flats
surrounding the river Humber. The great North Road (‘Watling Street,’
<i>Gest</i>, 18.<sup>2</sup>) between Doncaster and Pontefract, crosses
the small slow river Went at Wentbridge (probably referred to in st. 135
of the <i>Gest</i>), which may be taken as the northern boundary of
Barnsdale. That this part of the North Road was considered unsafe for
travellers as early as Edward <span class = "smallroman">I.</span>’s
reign is shown by the fact that a party going from Scotland to
Winchester, and for most of the journey guarded by a dozen archers, saw
fit to increase their number of guards to twenty between Pontefract and
Tickhill, the latter being on the border of Yorkshire and Nottingham,
south of Doncaster.</p>

<p>The remaining places, except those explained in the footnotes, may be
dealt with here.</p>

<p>‘Blyth’ (<i>Gest</i>, 27.<sup>4</sup>, 259.<sup>4</sup>), twice
mentioned as a place at which to dine, is a dozen miles south of
Doncaster, and in Nottingham; it is almost exactly half-way between
Barnsdale and Sherwood.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxix</span>
<a name = "pagexxix" id = "pagexxix"> </a>
<p>‘Verysdale’ (<i>Gest</i>, 126.<sup>4</sup>) may be Wyersdale,
a&nbsp;wild tract of the old Forest of Lancashire, near Lancaster.</p>

<p>‘Holderness’ (<i>Gest</i>, 149.<sup>1</sup>) is the nose of
Yorkshire; between the south-easterly turn of the Humber below Hull and
the North Sea.</p>

<p>‘Kyrkesly’ (<i>Gest</i>, 451.<sup>3</sup>, 454.<sup>3</sup>), or
‘Churchlees’ (<i>Robin Hood’s Death</i>, 1.<sup>3</sup>). Kirklees
Priory is on the left or north bank of the river Calder, a&nbsp;few
miles north of Huddersfield.</p>

<p>‘St. Mary Abbey’ is ‘here besyde’ (<i>Gest</i>, 54.<sup>4</sup>) and
in York (84.<sup>4</sup>).</p>


<h5 class = "section">Sherwood</h5>

<p>The name of Sherwood is not mentioned in the <i>Gest</i>, though that
of Nottingham is frequent. The old forest was a district about
twenty-five miles square, lying to the north of Nottingham, between that
town and Worksop, including Mansfield and, to the north, the district
now known as ‘the Dukeries,’ <i>i.e.</i> the parks of Welbeck, Clumber
and Rufford. There is a village of Sherwood, a&nbsp;northern suburb of
Nottingham, and a Sherwood Hall near Mansfield; between the two may be
found Friar Tuck’s Well, Robin Hood’s Well, Robin Hood’s Stable, and a
Robin Hood Hill. But, as has
<span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>
<a name = "pagexxx" id = "pagexxx"> </a>
been pointed out above, these names have little significance in view of
the fact that similarly-named objects can be found in other
counties.</p>

<p>It is more interesting to note that a pasture called ‘Robynhode
Closse’ (<i>i.e.</i> close) is mentioned in the Nottingham Chamberlain’s
accounts as early as 1485, and a ‘Robynhode Well’ in 1500.</p>

<p class = "verse">
‘Rebus huius Roberti gestis tota Britannia in cantibus utitur.’</p>

<p class = "right smallcaps">Major.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text.</span>&mdash;There are seven
texts of the <i>Gest</i>, to be distinguished as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i.) begins ‘Here begynneth a gest of Robyn Hode’; an undated printed
fragment preserved with other early pieces in a volume in the Advocates’
Library, Edinburgh. It was reprinted in 1827 by David Laing, who then
supposed it to be from the press of Chepman and Myllar, Edinburgh
printers of the early sixteenth century; but he afterwards had reason to
doubt this opinion. It is now attributed to Jan van Doesborch,
a&nbsp;printer from Antwerp. The extent of this fragment is indicated
below. Internal evidence (collected by Child, iii.&nbsp;40) shows it to
be an older text than</p>

<p>(ii.) ‘Here begynneth a lytell geste of Robyn hode’&mdash;so runs the
title-page; at the head of the poem are added the words&mdash;‘and his
meyne [=&nbsp;meinie, company], And of the proude Sheryfe of Notyngham.’
The colophon runs ‘Explycit. kynge Edwarde and Robyn hode and Lytell
Johan Enprented at London in fletestrete at the sygne of the sone By
Wynken de Worde.’ This also is undated, and Child says it ‘may be
anywhere from 1492 to 1534.’ Recent bibliographical research shows that
Wynkyn de Worde moved to Fleet Street at the end of the year 1500, which
gives the downward limit; and as the printer died in 1584, the <i>Lytell
Geste</i> must be
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2" id = "page2"> </a>
placed between those dates.<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_1" id =
"tag1_1" href = "#note1_1">1</a> The text is complete save for two lines
(7.<sup>1</sup> and 339.<sup>1</sup>), which have also dropped from the
other early texts. The only known copy is in the Cambridge University
Library.</p>

<p>(iii., iv. and v.) Three mutilated printed fragments, containing
about thirty-five, seventy, and fifteen stanzas respectively, preserved
amongst the Douce fragments in the Bodleian (the last presented by
J.&nbsp;O. Halliwell-Phillipps). The first was lent to Ritson in or
before 1790 by Farmer, who thought it to be Rastell’s printing; in
Ritson’s second edition (1836) he says he gave it to Douce, and states
without reason that it is of de Worde’s printing ‘probably in 1489.’</p>

<p>(vi.) <i>A mery geste of Robyn Hoode</i>, etc., a&nbsp;quarto
preserved in the British Museum, not dated, but printed ‘at London vpon
the thre Crane wharfe by wyllyam Copland,’ who printed there about 1560.
This edition also contains ‘a&nbsp;newe playe for to be played in Maye
games, very plesaunte and full of pastyme.’</p>

<p>(vii.) <i>A Merry Iest of Robin Hood</i>, etc., printed at London for
Edward White; no date, but perhaps the ‘pastorall plesant commedie’
entered to White in the Stationers’ Registers, May 14, 1594. There is a
copy of this in the Bodleian, and another was in the Huth Library.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> here given is mainly the
Wynkyn de Worde text, except where the earlier Edinburgh fragment is
available; the stanzas which the latter preserves are here numbered
1.-83.<sup>3</sup>, 113.<sup>4</sup>-124.<sup>1</sup>,
127.<sup>4</sup>-133.<sup>2</sup>, 136.<sup>4</sup>-208.<sup>3</sup>,

7.<sup>1</sup>. A&nbsp;few variations are recorded in the footnotes, it
being unnecessary in the present edition to do more than refer to
Child’s laborious collation of all the above texts.</p>

<p>The spelling of the old texts is retained with very few exceptions.
The reason for this is that although the original texts were printed in
the sixteenth century, the language is of the fifteenth, and a number of
Middle English forms remain; these are pointed out by Child, iii. 40,
and elaborately classified by W.&nbsp;H. Clawson, <i>The Gest of Robin
Hood</i>, 4-5. A&nbsp;possible alternative was to treat the <i>Gest</i>
on the plan adopted for fifteenth-century texts by E.&nbsp;K. Chambers
and the present editor in <i>Early English Lyrics</i> (1907); but in
that book the editors were mostly concerned with texts printed from
manuscript, whereas here there is good reason to suspect the existence
of a text or texts previous to those now available. For the sounded e
(ë) I&nbsp;have mostly followed Child.</p>

<p>The <i>Gest</i> is not a single ballad, but a conglomeration of
several, forming a short epic. Ballads representing its component parts
are not now extant; although on the other hand there are later ballads
founded on certain episodes in the <i>Gest</i>. The compiler availed
himself of incidents from other traditional sources, but he produced a
singularly original tale.</p>

<p>The word <i>gest</i>, now almost obsolete, is derived through Old
French from the Latin <i>gesta</i>, ‘deeds’ or ‘exploits.’ But as the
word was particularly applied to ‘exploits as narrated or recited,’
there came into use a secondary meaning&mdash;that of ‘a&nbsp;story or
romantic tale in verse,’ or ‘a&nbsp;metrical chronicle.’ The latter
meaning is doubtless intended in the title of the <i>Gest of Robyn
Hode</i>. A further corruption may be noticed even in the titles of the
later texts as

given above; Copland adds the word ‘mery,’ which thirty years later
causes White to print a ‘Merry Jest.’</p>

<p>I have kept the original divisions of the story into eight ‘fyttes,’
but it falls more naturally into three main sections, in each of which a
complete story is narrated. These may he distinguished thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "hanging">
<p>1. <span class = "smallcaps">Robin Hood and the Knight.</span><br>
(Fyttes First, Second, and Fourth.)</p>

<p>2. <span class = "smallcaps">Robin Hood, Little John, and the Sheriff
of Nottingham.</span><br>
(Fyttes Third, Fifth, and Sixth.)</p>

<p>3. <span class = "smallcaps">Robin Hood and King Edward.</span><br>
(Fyttes Seventh and Eighth.)</p>
</div>

<p>An argument and general notes are prefixed to each fytte.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">5</span>

<h4 class = "chapter"><a name = "gest1" id = "gest1">
THE FIRST FYTTE (1-81)</a></h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;Robin Hood refuses
to dine until he finds some guest to provide money for his
entertainment. He sends Little John and all his men to bring in any
earl, baron, abbot, or knight, to dine with him. They find a knight, and
feast him beneath the greenwood tree: but when Robin demands payment,
the knight turns out to be in sorry plight, for he has sold all his
goods to save his son. On the security of Our Lady, Robin lends him four
hundred pounds, and gives him a livery, a&nbsp;horse, a&nbsp;palfrey,
boots, spurs, etc., and Little John as squire.</p>

<p>Robin’s unwillingness to dine until he has a guest appears to be a
parody of King Arthur’s custom of refusing dinner until he has had an
adventure. (See Child, i. 257, note ‡.) The offer of the Virgin as
security for a loan is apparently derived from a well-known miracle of
Mary, in which a Christian, wishing to borrow money of a Jew, takes him
to a church and makes him lay his hand on a statue of the Virgin and
Child, praying that, if he fails to return the money on the day fixed to
the lender, but gives it to the statue, Christ will return it to the
Jew. This miracle eventually takes place, but is attributed rather to
the Virgin than to her Son. (See Child, iii.&nbsp;52.)</p>

THE SECOND FYTTE (82-143)</a></h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;The knight goes to
York to pay down his four hundred pounds to the abbot of St. Mary Abbey,
who has retained the services of the high justice of England ‘with cloth
and fee,’ an offence defined as conspiracy by statutes of the first
three Edwards (see <i>Notes and Queries</i>, First Series, vol. vi.
p.&nbsp;479). The knight, pretending he has not brought the money,
requests an extension of time; but the abbot will not hear of it, and is
supported in his refusal by the justice: the knight’s lands will be
forfeited. The justice advises the abbot (117, etc.) to give the knight
a sum to ‘make a release’ and prevent subsequent legal difficulties. The
knight brings the matter to an end by paying down the four hundred
pounds, saying that had the abbot been more courteous, he should have
had interest on the loan.</p>

<p>The knight returns to his home in Wyresdale, and saves up the sum to
be repaid to Robin Hood. As he sets out for Barnsdale with a goodly
company, he finds a great wrestling-match taking place at Wentbridge,<a

which delays him a while.</p>

<p>The word ‘frembde’ (138.<sup>3</sup>) is now obsolete except in Scots
and north-country dialect, and is spelled in various ways. It occurs
more than once in Chaucer, and twice in Sidney’s <i>Arcadia</i>.
‘Fremit,’ the common Scots form, may be found in Burns. More

recently, it appears in books of Westmoreland, Cumberland, or
Northumberland dialect. Cp. Mrs. Gaskell, <i>Sylvia’s Lovers</i>:
‘There’s a fremd man i’ t’ house.’ It means ‘foreign’ or ‘strange.’</p>

THE THIRD FYTTE (144-204)</a></h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;The narrative of the
knight’s loan is for the moment dropped, in order to relate a gest of
Little John, who is now (81.<sup>2</sup>) the knight’s ‘knave’ or
squire. Going forth ‘upon a mery day,’ Little John shoots with such
skill that he attracts the attention of the Sheriff of Nottingham (who
is here and elsewhere the type of Robin Hood’s enemies), and enters his
service for a year under the name of Reynold Greenleaf. While the
sheriff is hunting, Little John fights his servants, robs his
treasure-house, and escapes back to Robin Hood with ‘three hundred pound
and more.’ He then bethinks him of a shrewd wile, and inveigles the
sheriff to leave his hunting in order to see a right fair hart and seven
score of deer, which turn out to be Robin and his men. Robin Hood exacts
an oath of the sheriff, equivalent to an armistice; and he returns home,
having had his fill of the greenwood.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;Robin Hood will not
dine until he has ‘his pay,’ and he therefore sends Little John with
Much and Scarlok to wait for an ‘unketh gest.’ They capture a monk of
St. Mary Abbey, and Robin Hood makes him disgorge eight hundred pounds.
The monk, we are told, was on his way to London to take proceedings
against the knight.</p>

<p>In due course the knight, who was left at the end of the second fytte
at the wrestling-match, arrives to pay his debt to Robin Hood; who,
however, refuses to receive it, saying that Our Lady had discharged the
loan already.</p>

money lent on her security, is not without parallels, some of which

THE FIFTH FYTTE (281-316)</a></h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;The story now
returns to the Sheriff of Nottingham, and relates how he offered a prize
for the best archer in the north. Robin Hood, hearing of this match,
determines to go to it, and to test the sheriff’s faith to his oath (see
the Third Fytte, stt. 202-4). Robin wins the prize, and is starting home
to the greenwood, when the sheriff recognises and attacks him, but is
beaten off by a shower of arrows. Robin and his men retire, shooting as
they go, until they come to a castle. Here dwells the knight to whom
Robin had lent the money&mdash;‘Sir Richard at the Lee.’ He takes in
Robin and his men, and defies the sheriff; Robin, he says, shall spend
forty days with him.</p>

<p>This fytte is no doubt based on some single lost ballad of a
shooting-match at which Robin was victorious, and at which the Sheriff
of Nottingham attempted in vain to arrest him. But the compiler of the
<i>Gest</i> has carefully linked it to the preceding fyttes by such
references as Robin’s determination to try the sheriff’s faith
(st.&nbsp;287), which is made clear in stt. 296-8; and the
identification of the knight whose castle protects Robin and his men
with the knight to whom the money had been lent (stt. 310-312).</p>

THE SIXTH FYTTE (317-353)</a></h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;The Sheriff of
Nottingham secures the assistance of the High Sheriff, and besets the
knight’s castle, accusing him of harbouring the king’s enemies. The
knight bids him appeal to the king, saying he will ‘avow’ (<i>i.e.</i>
make good or justify) all he has done, on the pledge of all his lands.
The sheriffs raise the siege and go to London, where the king says he
will be at Nottingham in two weeks and will capture both the knight and
Robin Hood. The sheriff returns home to get together a band of archers
to assist the king; but meanwhile Robin has escaped to the greenwood.
However, the sheriff lies in wait for the knight, captures him and takes
him bound to Nottingham. The knight’s lady rides to Robin and begs him
to save her lord; whereupon Robin and his men hasten to Nottingham, kill
the sheriff, release the knight, and carry him off to the greenwood.</p>

<p>The latter episode&mdash;of Robin’s release, at the request of his
wife, of a knight taken captive by the sheriff&mdash;comes probably from
a separate ballad: <i>Robin Hood rescuing Three Squires</i> tells a
similar story. This the compiler of the <i>Gest</i> has apparently woven
in with the story of the previous fyttes, though he has not done so very
thoroughly (<i>e.g.</i>, the inconsistency of Robin’s question to the
knight’s wife, ‘What man hath your lord i-take?’ with his knowledge of
the knight’s defiance of the sheriff). The compiler has also neatly
prepared the way for the introduction of the seventh and eighth fyttes
by the knight’s appeal
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<a name = "page65" id = "page65"> </a>
to the king; but, having done so, he has apparently forgotten the king’s
undertaking to come to Nottingham, and has allowed the sheriff to
anticipate that plan and capture the knight without assistance.</p>

THE SEVENTH FYTTE (354-417)</a></h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;The king, coming
with a great array to Nottingham to take Robin Hood and the knight, and
finding nothing but a great scarcity of deer, is wondrous wroth, and
promises the knight’s lands to any one who will bring him his head. For
half a year the king has no news of Robin; at length, at the suggestion
of a forester, he disguises himself as an abbot and five of his men as
monks, and goes into the greenwood. He is met and stopped by Robin Hood,
gives up forty pounds to him, and alleges he is a messenger from the
king. Thereupon Robin entertains him and his men on the king’s own deer,
and the outlaws hold an archery competition, Robin smiting those that
miss. At his last shot, Robin himself misses, and asks the abbot to
smite him in his turn. The abbot gives him such a buffet that Robin is
nearly felled; on looking more closely, he recognises the king, of whom
he and his men ask pardon on their knees. The king grants it, on
condition that they will enter his service. Robin agrees, but reserves
the right to return to the greenwood if he mislikes the court.</p>

<p>This fytte is based on the story, extremely common and essentially
popular, especially in England, of a meeting between a king in disguise
and one of his subjects. Doubtless there was a ballad of Robin Hood and
the king; but the only one we possess, <i>The King’s Disguise and
Friendship with Robin Hood</i>, is a late and a loose paraphrase of this
fytte and the next. The commonest stories and ballads of
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<a name = "page73" id = "page73"> </a>
this type in English are <i>The King and the Barker</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
Tanner), <i>King Edward the Fourth and the Tanner of Tamworth</i>,
<i>King James and the Tinker</i>, and <i>King Henry II. and the Miller
of Mansfield</i>. Usually the point of the story is the lack of ceremony
displayed by the subject, and the royal good-humour and largesse of the
king.</p>

<p>There is only an arbitrary division between Fyttes <span class =
"smallroman">VII.</span> and <span class = "smallroman">VIII.</span>;
and one or two other points will be discussed in introducing the next

THE EIGHTH FYTTE (418-456)</a></h4>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Argument.</span>&mdash;For a jest, the king
disguises himself and his men once more, this time in Lincoln green,
which he purchases off Robin Hood. The whole party proceeds to
Nottingham, where the appearance of so many green mantles causes a
general flight of the inhabitants. The king, however, reveals himself,
and after a feast, pardons the knight.</p>

<p>Robin dwells in the king’s court for fifteen months, at the end of
which time he has spent much money, and has lost all his men except
Little John and Scathlock. He therefore begs the king’s leave to go on a
pilgrimage to a shrine of St. Mary Magdalen in Barnsdale, and the king
consents, but allows him only seven nights’ absence. Robin comes to the
greenwood, and shoots a great hart; and on blowing his horn, seven score
yeomen come and welcome him back, and he dwells two-and-twenty years in
the greenwood. In the end he was betrayed by his kinswoman, the Prioress
of Kirkesly Abbey, and her lover, Sir Roger of Doncaster.</p>

<p>It has been suggested (by Professor Brandl) that the episode of the
king’s disguise in green is an intentional variation of the episode in
the Third Fytte, where the Sheriff of Nottingham is forced to wrap
himself in a green mantle. In any case it is probable that most of this
Eighth Fytte is the work of the compiler of the <i>Gest</i>; possibly
even the delightful verses (stt. 445-6) in which the joy of greenwood
life overcomes Robin.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<a name = "page85" id = "page85"> </a>
<p>One could wish the <i>Gest</i> ended with st. 450; but it is clear
that the compiler knew of a ballad which narrated the death of Robin
Hood, no doubt an earlier version of the <i>Robin Hood’s Death</i> of
the Percy Folio, a&nbsp;ballad unfortunately incomplete (see
p.&nbsp;140).</p>

<p>Every famous outlaw of English tradition visits the king’s court
sooner or later, and makes peace with the king; but Robin’s independence
was too dear to him&mdash;and to the ballad-singers whose ideal he
was&mdash;to allow him to go to the king voluntarily. Therefore the king
must come to Robin; and here the compiler, perhaps, saw his opportunity
to introduce the king-in-disguise theme, and so evolved the two last
fyttes of the <i>Gest</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is modernised, as far as is
possible, from a <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> of about 1500 in
the University Library at Cambridge (Ee.&nbsp;4,&nbsp;35). The ballad
was first printed therefrom by Ritson in his <i>Robin Hood</i> (1795),
vol.&nbsp;i. p.&nbsp;81, on the whole very accurately, and with a few
necessary emendations. He notes that the scribe was evidently
‘a&nbsp;vulgar and illiterate person’ who ‘irremediably corrupted’ the
ballad. In several places, however, a&nbsp;little ingenuity will restore
a lost rhyme.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span>, of an outlaw disguising
himself in order to gain information from his enemies, is common to the
legends of Hereward the Saxon, Wallace, Eustace the monk, and Fulk Fitz
Warine, the first three of whom assumed the guise of a potter at one
time or another.</p>

<p>The ballad of <i>Robin Hood and the Butcher</i> is a tale similar to
this; and part of the Play of Robin Hood is based on this ballad (see
Introduction, p.&nbsp;xxiii.).</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text.</span>&mdash;The only text of
this ballad is in the Percy Folio, from which it is here rendered in
modern spelling. Although the original is written continuously, it is
almost impossible not to suspect an omission after 2.<sup>2</sup>. Child
points out, however, that the abrupt transition is found in other
ballads (see <i>Adam Bell</i>, 2.<sup>2</sup>), and Hales and Furnivall
put 2.<sup>3,4</sup> in inverted commas as part of Robin’s relation of
his dream. Percy’s emendation was:</p>

<div class = "verse intro">
<p>‘The woodweete sang, and wold not cese,</p>
<p class = "inset">Sitting upon the spraye,</p>
<p>Soe lowde, he wakend Robin Hood</p>

</div>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;Whether verses have
been lost or not, the story has become confused, as there is nothing to
show how Robin knows that the Sheriff of Nottingham holds Little John
captive; yet he makes careful preparations to pass himself off as Sir
Guy, in order to set John free.</p>

<p>There has come down to us a fragment of a play of Robin Hood and the
Sheriff.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_2" id = "tag2_2" href =
"#note2_2">2</a> In this dramatic
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<a name = "page129" id = "page129"> </a>
fragment, an unnamed knight is promised a reward by the sheriff if he
takes Robin Hood. The knight and Robin shoot and wrestle and fight;
Robin wins, cuts off the knight’s head, puts on his clothes, and takes
the head away with him. A&nbsp;second scene shows how the sheriff takes
prisoner the other outlaws, amongst whom is Friar Tuck; but the
allocation of the parts in the dialogue is mostly conjectural.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">ROBIN HOOD’S DEATH</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is modernised from the
Percy Folio <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> (c.&nbsp;1650). At two
points, after 8.<sup>3</sup> and 18.<sup>2</sup>, half a page of the
<span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, or about nine stanzas, is
missing&mdash;torn out and ‘used by maids to light the fire’ in Humphry
Pitt’s house, where Percy discovered the volume (see Introduction, First
Series, xxxix.). At the end another half-page is lacking, but Child
thinks that it represents only a few verses. He also indicates a lacuna
after st. 4, though none appears in the <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span></p>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> of this version, mutilated as
it is, agrees in its main incidents with that given at the end of the
<i>Gest</i> (stt. 451-455). Another variant, <i>Robin Hood’s Death and
Burial</i>, extant in two or three eighteenth-century ‘Garlands,’ but
none the less of good derivation, gives no assistance at either hiatus,
and we are left with a couple of puzzles.</p>

<p>The opening of the ballad, stt. 1-6, should be compared with <i>Robin
Hood and the Monk</i>, stt. 6-10, where Much takes Will Scarlett’s
place. Robin, shooting for a penny with Little John along the way, comes
to a black water with a plank across it, and an old woman on the plank
is cursing Robin Hood. He has been already reminded by Scarlett that he
has a yeoman foe at Kirklees; but neither the banning of the witch, nor
the weeping of others (‘We,’ 9.<sup>3</sup>), presumably women, deter
him. The explanation of the witch is lost.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<a name = "page141" id = "page141"> </a>
<p>Having arrived at Kirklees and submitted to being bled, Robin at
length suspects treason, and hints as much to Little John. The latter
may be indoors with his master, or, as Child thinks, calling to Robin
through a window from below. Here the second hiatus occurs; and when the
ballad resumes, we can only guess that st. 19 is Robin’s final retort
after an altercation with somebody, presumably Red Roger, who is perhaps
the ‘yeoman’ referred to by Will Scarlett. A&nbsp;final difficulty is
raised by the word ‘mood’ in st. 23; but Child’s emendation is not
improbable, and Robin himself realises that he must take his ‘housel’ in
an irregular way.</p>

<p>In the Garland version Robin goes alone to Kirklees, where his
‘cousin’ bleeds him, and leaves him to bleed all day and all night in a
locked room. He summons Little John with ‘weak blasts three’ of his
horn, and bids him dig a grave where the last arrow shot by Robin Hood
falls.</p>

CLOUDESLY</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text.</span>&mdash;The earliest
complete text, here given, was printed by William Copland between 1548
and 1568: there are extant two printed fragments, one printed by John
Byddell in 1536, and the other in a type older than Copland’s. Later,
there are two editions printed by James Roberts in 1605; and finally a
<span class = "smallroman"><ins class = "correction"
title = "printed at full size">MS.</ins></span>
text in the Percy Folio (c.&nbsp;1650).</p>

<p>Copland’s text is obviously full of faults, and in emendations I have
mostly followed Child.</p>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span>, lively and admirably told,
contains little extrinsic interest, except in William’s feat of shooting
the apple from his son’s head. This is inevitably associated with the
legend of William Tell, which is told in the White Book of Obwalden,
written about 1470; but similar stories can be found in the Icelandic
Saga of Dietrich of Bern (about 1250) and in Saxo Grammaticus, who wrote
his Danish History about the year 1200. Three or four other versions of
the story are to be found in German and Scandinavian literature before
the date of our ballad; but they all agree in two points which are
missing in the English ballad&mdash;the shot is compulsory, and the
archer reserves another arrow for purposes of revenge in case he misses
his mark. William of Cloudesly volunteers a difficult and risky feat out
of bravado.</p>

<p>The rescue of Cloudesly by Adam Bell and Clym of the Clough may be
compared with the rescue

<h4 class = "chapter">JOHNNY O’ COCKLEY’S WELL</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is taken almost entirely
from a copy which was sent in 1780 to Bishop Percy by a Miss Fisher of
Carlisle; in the last half of the first stanza her version gives,
unintelligibly:</p>

<div class = "verse intro">
<p>‘But little knew he that his bloody hounds</p>
<p class = "inset">Were bound in iron bands’:</p>
</div>

<p>and I have therefore substituted lines from a later text. The
correction in 20.<sup>1</sup> and 21.<sup>1</sup> is also essential.</p>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> will be familiar to many as
<i>Johnie of Breadislee</i>, a title given by Sir Walter Scott to his
version, the first that was published, in the <i>Minstrelsy</i> (1802).
In the present version, however, Johnny certainly belongs to Cockley’s
Well, Bradyslee being only the name of his hunting-ground. In other
variants, his name is Johnny Cock, Johnny Cox, Johnny o’ Cockis, o’
Cockerslee, of Cockielaw, of Cocklesmuir, or Johnny Brad. The name of
the hunting-ground varies also, though not so widely; and, as usual, the
several editors of the ballad have carefully noted that its topography
(though the nomenclature is corrupted) connects it with this district or
that&mdash;Percy’s ballad is Northumbrian, Scott’s is of
Dumfriesshire.</p>

<p>Percy considered that the mention of wolves (17.<sup>1</sup>) was an
indication of the antiquity of the ballad; whereupon Child quotes
Holinshed (1577) as saying that ‘though the island is void of wolves
south of the
<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<a name = "page178" id = "page178"> </a>
Tweed, yet the Scots cannot boast the like, since they have grievous
wolves.’ Yet how can one reconcile the mention of wolves with the
reference to ‘American leather’ (13.<sup>3</sup>)?</p>

<p>Professor Child calls this a ‘precious specimen of the unspoiled
traditional ballad,’ and Professor Gummere points out that ‘it goes with
a burden, this sterling old song, and has traces of an incremental
repetition that has been reduced to lowest terms by impatient
transcribers’ (<i>The Popular Ballad</i>, p.&nbsp;268). In his <i>Old
English Ballads</i> Gummere gives a text very ingeniously compounded of
Percy’s and Kinloch’s; and Professor Brandl has attempted to restore the
original text.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is derived, with trivial

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> of this Scots outlaw makes
tame reading after those which precede it in this volume. The ballad was
inserted at the end of Child’s collection only because he preferred ‘to
err by including rather than excluding.’ He adds, ‘I&nbsp;am convinced
that it did not begin its existence as a popular ballad, and I am not
convinced that (as&nbsp;Scott asserts) it has been for ages a popular
song in Selkirkshire.’ Nevertheless, it undoubtedly gained a place in
popular tradition; and this, while entitling it to a place here, renders
the elaborate historical investigation, to which it has been submitted
since Child’s edition, a&nbsp;waste of erudition and ingenuity.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">SIR ANDREW BARTON</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is taken from the Percy
Folio <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, but the spelling is
modernised. There is another version, extant in broadsides to be found
in nearly all the large collections; this, when set beside the Folio
<span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> text, provides a remarkable
instance of the loss a ballad sustained by falling into the hands of the
broadside-printers. The present text, despite the unlucky hiatus after
st. 35, is a splendid example of an English ballad, which cannot be
earlier than the sixteenth century. There is a fine rhythm throughout,
and, as Child says, ‘not many better passages are met with in ballad
poetry than that which tells of the three gallant attempts on the
mainmast tree (stt. 52-66).’</p>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> told in the ballad is a piece
of history, and belongs originally to the beginning of the sixteenth
century. Andrew Barton was one of three sons of John Barton,
a&nbsp;Scots trader whose ship had been plundered by the Portuguese in
1476; letters of reprisal were granted to the brothers Barton, and
renewed to them in 1506 ‘as no opportunity had occurred of effectuating
a retaliation.’ It seems, however, that this privilege was abused, at
least by Andrew, who was reported in June 1511 to Henry <span class =
"smallroman">VIII.</span> as seizing English ships under the pretext
that they were Portuguese. The king did not send Lord Charles Howard, as
the ballad states&mdash;Lord Charles
<span class = "pagenum">197</span>
<a name = "page197" id = "page197"> </a>
was not born till twenty-five years afterwards&mdash;but Sir Thomas and
Sir Edward Howard set out against the pirate by Henry’s leave. They took
two ships, not one, the meeting with Henry Hunt (st.&nbsp;18) being the
ballad-maker’s invention. Lord Charles’s fraudulent use of the ‘white
flag’ in st. 37 is supported by Bishop Lesley’s partisan account of the
engagement, written <i>c.</i> 1570. The time-scheme of the ballad is
unusually vague: it begins ‘in midsummer-time,’ and the punitive
expedition starts on ‘the day before midsummer even’&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
June 19, which agrees with the chronicles. The fight takes place within
the week; but Lord Charles does not get home until December 29
(st.&nbsp;71). Hall’s chronicle says that they returned on
August&nbsp;2.</p>

<p>Lord Charles Howard was created Earl of Nottingham in 1596; but the
adoption of this into the ballad (st.&nbsp;78) dates only our text. It
is quite probable that it existed in a previous version with names and
facts more correctly stated.</p>

from North Devon tradition by the Rev. S.&nbsp;Baring Gould, and printed
by Child; since when other versions have been found still in circulation
in England. A&nbsp;Sussex version, though perhaps derived from a Catnach
broadside, is given in the <i>Journal</i> of the Folk-Song Society, vol.
i. 162.</p>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;This ballad is
undoubtedly a degenerate version of the preceding, <i>Sir Andrew
Barton</i>, of which name, as Child says, Henry Martyn would be no
extraordinary corruption. It is given here as an instance of the fate
which awaits a popular ballad in the process of being sung to
pieces.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Ravenscroft’s

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;‘Good King John of

the earliest literary reference to this ballad occurs in the play of
<i><ins class = "correction" title =
"usual spelling is ‘Gammer’">Gammar</ins>
Gurton’s Needle</i>, acted in 1566, where the
song ‘I&nbsp;cannot eat but little meat’ is to be sung ‘to the tune of
John Dory.’ From Carew’s <i>Survey of Cornwall</i> (1602) we learn a
little more: ‘Moreover, the prowess of one Nicholas, son to a widow near
Foy [Fowey], is descanted upon in an old three-man’s song, namely, how
he fought bravely at sea with John Dory (a&nbsp;Genowey, as I
conjecture), set forth by John, the French king, and, after much
bloodshed on both sides, took, and slew him, in revenge of the great
ravine and cruelty which he had fore committed upon the Englishmen’s
goods and bodies.’</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">CAPTAIN WARD AND THE RAINBOW</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from a broadside in the
Bagford collection (i.&nbsp;65); other broadsides, very similar, are to
be found in the Pepys, Roxburghe, and other collections. The ballad has
often been reprinted; and more than one oral version has been
recovered&mdash;much corrupted in transmission.</p>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> is apocryphal, as has been
shown by research undertaken since Child annotated the ballad; so also
are other broadsides, <i>The Seamen’s Song of Captain Ward</i> and
<i>The Seamen’s Song of Dansekar</i>, which deal with Ward. He was a
Kentish fisherman, born at Feversham about 1555, who turned pirate after
a short service aboard the <i>Lion’s Whelp</i> man-of-war. The
<i>Rainbow</i> was the name of a ship then in the navy, often mentioned
in reports from 1587 onwards; but Professor Sir J.&nbsp;K. Laughton has
pointed out that she never fought with Ward. Possibly <i>Rainbow</i> is
a corruption of <i>Tramontana</i>, a small cruiser which <i>may</i> have
chased him once in the Irish Channel. The fullest account of Ward may be
found in an article, unsigned, but written by Mr. John Masefield, in the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for March, 1906, pp. 113-126.</p>

<h4 class = "chapter">THE SWEET TRINITY</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is taken from a broadside
in the Pepys collection (iv.&nbsp;196), which can be dated between 1682
and 1685, and is entitled <i>Sir Walter Raleigh sailing in the
Low-lands</i>. Three other copies of the same edition of the broadside
are known.</p>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story</span> of the <i>Sweet Trinity</i>
has become confused with that of the <i>Golden Vanity</i> (<i>Golden
Victorie</i>, <i>Golden Trinitie</i>, <i>Gold Pinnatree</i> are
variants), which is probably a corrupted form of it; indeed the weak
ending of the broadside challenges any singer to improve upon it. But
again there are two distinct variations of the <i>Golden Vanity</i>
ballad. In the first class, the boy, having sunk the French galley,
calls to the <i>Golden Vanity</i> to throw him a rope, and when it is
refused, threatens to sink her too; whereupon they take him aboard and
carry out all their promises of reward (which vary considerably in the
different versions). In the second class, the boy dies after he is taken
up from the water; in one version he sinks from exhaustion before he can
be saved.</p>

<p>The <i>Sweet Trinity</i>, however, has been taken by a ship of
unspecified nationality (‘false’ might easily become corrupted into
‘French’); and thus this ballad deals with three ships, while the
<i>Golden Vanity</i> versions mention but two. The latter are still
current in folk-song.</p>

<h5><b>Ballads of Romance and Chivalry. 1903.</b></h5>

<p>‘It forms an excellent introduction to a sadly neglected source of
poetry.’ &mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>‘There can be nothing but praise for the selection, editing, and
notes, which are all excellent and adequate. It is, in fine,
a&nbsp;valuable volume of what bids fair to be a very valuable series.’
&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>‘The most serviceable edition of the ballads yet published in
England.’ &mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Second Series.</h5>

<h5><b>Ballads of Mystery and Miracle and Fyttes of Mirth.
1904.</b></h5>

<p>‘It includes many beautiful and well-known ballads, and no pains have
been spared by the editor in producing them, so far as may be, in their
entirety.’ &mdash;<i>World.</i></p>

<p>‘The second volume . . . carries out the promise of the
first.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Even after Professor Kittredge’s compressed
edition of Child,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr. Sidgwick’s work abundantly
justifies its existence.’ &mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<h5><b>Ballads of Scottish Tradition and Romance. 1906.</b></h5>

<p>‘This book is as good a model of fine and careful editing as the two
earlier volumes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr. Sidgwick’s selections could
not be bettered, nor could he have arranged them more attractively.’
&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p>‘There can be no doubt that when the series is completed it will be
the best cheap and popular and representative collection.’
